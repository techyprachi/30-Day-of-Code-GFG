Day 17: More Exceptions â€“ Power Function

ðŸ”¹ Task:
Create a class `Calculator` with a method `power(n, p)` that returns n raised to the power p.  
If either `n` or `p` is negative, throw an exception with the message:  
    n and p should be non-negative

ðŸ”¹ Input Format:
- First line: Integer `T`, number of test cases  
- Next `T` lines: Two space-separated integers `n` and `p`

ðŸ”¹ Output Format:
- Print the result of `n^p` for each test case  
- If an exception is thrown, print:  
    n and p should be non-negative

ðŸ”¹ Constraints:
- No test case will result in overflow  
- -100 â‰¤ n, p â‰¤ 100
