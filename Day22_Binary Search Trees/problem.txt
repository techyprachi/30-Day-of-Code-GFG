Day 22: Binary Search Trees – Height of a BST

🔹 Task:
Complete the function `getHeight(root)` that returns the height of a binary search tree.  
Height is defined as the number of edges from the root to the deepest leaf.

🔹 Input Format:
- First line: Integer `n`, number of nodes in the BST  
- Next `n` lines: Each line contains an integer `data` to be inserted into the BST

🔹 Output Format:
Print a single integer — the height of the BST

🔹 Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
1 ≤ data ≤ 10⁴

🔹 Sample Input:
7  
3  
5  
2  
1  
4  
6  
7

🔹 Sample Output:
3

🔹 Explanation:
The BST formed has the longest path: 3 → 5 → 6 → 7  
This path has 3 edges, so the height is 3
