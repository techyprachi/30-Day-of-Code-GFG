Day 23: BST Level-Order Traversal – Breadth-First Search

🔹 Task:
Complete the function `levelOrder(root)` to perform a level-order traversal (BFS) of a binary search tree.  
Print the node values in left-to-right order, level by level.

🔹 Function Signature:
- `levelOrder(root)`  
- Parameter: `root` → reference to the root node  
- Output: Print space-separated node values in level-order

🔹 Hint:
Use a queue to process nodes level by level.

🔹 Input Format:
- First line: Integer `n`, number of nodes  
- Next `n` lines: Each line contains an integer `data` to be inserted into the BST

🔹 Output Format:
Print the node values in level-order traversal as a single line of space-separated integers.

🔹 Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
1 ≤ data ≤ 10⁴

🔹 Sample Input:
6  
3  
5  
4  
7  
2  
1

🔹 Sample Output:
3 2 5 1 4 7

🔹 Explanation:
The BST formed looks like this:
        3  
      /   \  
     2     5  
    /     / \  
   1     4   7  

Level-order traversal visits nodes:  
→ 3 → 2 → 5 → 1 → 4 → 7  
Print them in a single line separated by spaces.
