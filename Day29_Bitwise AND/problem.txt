🔹 Day 29: Bitwise AND – Maximum Under Limit

🔹 Task:
Given a set of integers from 1 to N, find the maximum value of `a & b` such that:
- 1 ≤ a < b ≤ N  
- (a & b) < K

🔹 Function Signature:
bitwiseAnd(int N, int K) → int

🔹 Input Format:
- First line: Integer `T`, number of test cases  
- Next `T` lines: Each line contains two space-separated integers `N` and `K`

🔹 Output Format:
For each test case, print the maximum value of `a & b` that is less than `K`

🔹 Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000  
- 2 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10⁶

🔹 Sample Input:
3  
5 2  
8 5  
2 2

🔹 Sample Output:
1  
4  
0

🔹 Explanation:
Test Case 1:  
All valid (a, b)
